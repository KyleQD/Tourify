# Phase 10 — Global Creator Governance Federation Readiness

## Purpose

Define a future handoff for federated creator-governed organizations, interoperable member credentials, cross-border data institutions and approved representation networks.

## Primary workflows

1. Prove Phase 9 entity independence, member governance, research ethics, benefit allocation and cross-border controls.
2. Define federation membership and sovereignty.
3. Create interoperable but revocable credentials and mandates.
4. Prevent one entity from overriding another’s member decisions.
5. Obtain regulator and standards engagement before production.

## Required controls

- Phase 10 cannot launch from Phase 9 feature flags.
- No global representation mandate by inference.
- No cross-entity data pooling without new contribution and transfer approval.

## Primary records

- `future_phase10_approval_packages`
## Canonical source-of-truth rules

- `artist_music` remains the catalog anchor; Phase 9 stores references and approved extracts, not replacement catalog rows.
- Rights Passports, Phase 6 licences and Phase 7 administration/enforcement records remain immutable source evidence.
- Phase 8 consent, privacy and benchmark decisions are inputs, but cooperative membership and data contribution require new, separately executed records.
- External research institutions, regulators, standards bodies, CMOs, courts and government registries remain authoritative for their own decisions and filings.
- Every derived dataset, analysis, publication and benefit allocation points to an immutable input manifest and policy version.

## Stop conditions

Stop the workflow when any of the following is true:

- membership, contribution licence, consent, authority or permitted purpose is missing or expired;
- the source dataset cannot be reproduced from an approved lineage manifest;
- the cohort fails minimum-size, independence, concentration, delay or re-identification controls;
- the request would expose current or future competitive strategy, prices, bids, rates or contract positions;
- research ethics, privacy, security, export, IP, competition or jurisdiction review is incomplete;
- an output could be interpreted as legal, tax, investment or coordinated pricing advice;
- the board, member vote, independent committee or outside authority required by policy has not approved the action;
- a member withdrawal, legal hold, regulator request or incident requires processing to pause.

## Existing-system integration

- Consume approved, versioned extracts through adapters or event outboxes; never query confidential operational tables directly from public or researcher-facing routes.
- Do not modify upload, stream, entitlement, player, feed, profile, EPK, marketplace, licensing, rights-administration, royalty or mobile behavior.
- Keep Phase 9 routes under a dedicated namespace and behind feature, jurisdiction and entity-readiness flags.
- Use route handlers under `app/api/**`, colocated Zod schemas, `requireApiUser`, `jsonError`, additive migrations and explicit RLS.
- Use restricted storage, short-lived signed URLs, access logs and output review for all cooperative and research files.

## Required tests

- membership versus ordinary Tourify-account separation;
- purpose-specific contribution and revocation behavior;
- RLS for members, directors, committee reviewers, researchers, administrators and workers;
- small-cohort, concentration, stale-source and re-identification stop conditions;
- default-deny research access and output release;
- competition-sensitive content detection and escalation;
- idempotent external submissions and compensating rollback;
- regression coverage for upload, playback, entitlement, marketplace, feed, profile, EPK, analytics and mobile.

## Completion evidence

Codex may mark this area complete only after it records:

1. audited repository paths and deployed database objects;
2. approved legal/entity/governance assumptions and named operational owners;
3. migrations, generated types, RLS tests and route tests;
4. privacy, ethics, competition, security and jurisdiction review evidence;
5. feature flags, stop conditions, monitoring and rollback instructions; and
6. task-level files changed, commands run, test results and unresolved blockers in `phase-9-execution-plan.json`.
