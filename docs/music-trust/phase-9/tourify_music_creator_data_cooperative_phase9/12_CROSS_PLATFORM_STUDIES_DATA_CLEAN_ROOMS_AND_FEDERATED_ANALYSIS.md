# Cross-Platform Studies, Clean Rooms and Federated Analysis

## Purpose

Enable studies across DSP, social, ticketing, licensing, royalty and rights-administration sources without centralizing unnecessary raw data.

## Primary workflows

1. Approve each source partner and data-sharing agreement.
2. Map identifiers through controlled linkage services.
3. Run approved queries in isolated environments.
4. Apply cohort, concentration, purpose and output controls.
5. Reconcile partner-computed aggregates and document discrepancies.

## Required controls

- No partner may reuse cooperative data for its own model training or unrelated profiling without a separate licence.
- Identifier linkage keys remain segregated from research outputs.
- Cross-platform joins must be disabled when they materially increase re-identification risk.

## Primary records

- `phase9_data_partners`
- `phase9_linkage_jobs`
- `phase9_federated_queries`
- `phase9_partner_reconciliations`
## Canonical source-of-truth rules

- `artist_music` remains the catalog anchor; Phase 9 stores references and approved extracts, not replacement catalog rows.
- Rights Passports, Phase 6 licences and Phase 7 administration/enforcement records remain immutable source evidence.
- Phase 8 consent, privacy and benchmark decisions are inputs, but cooperative membership and data contribution require new, separately executed records.
- External research institutions, regulators, standards bodies, CMOs, courts and government registries remain authoritative for their own decisions and filings.
- Every derived dataset, analysis, publication and benefit allocation points to an immutable input manifest and policy version.

## Stop conditions

Stop the workflow when any of the following is true:

- membership, contribution licence, consent, authority or permitted purpose is missing or expired;
- the source dataset cannot be reproduced from an approved lineage manifest;
- the cohort fails minimum-size, independence, concentration, delay or re-identification controls;
- the request would expose current or future competitive strategy, prices, bids, rates or contract positions;
- research ethics, privacy, security, export, IP, competition or jurisdiction review is incomplete;
- an output could be interpreted as legal, tax, investment or coordinated pricing advice;
- the board, member vote, independent committee or outside authority required by policy has not approved the action;
- a member withdrawal, legal hold, regulator request or incident requires processing to pause.

## Existing-system integration

- Consume approved, versioned extracts through adapters or event outboxes; never query confidential operational tables directly from public or researcher-facing routes.
- Do not modify upload, stream, entitlement, player, feed, profile, EPK, marketplace, licensing, rights-administration, royalty or mobile behavior.
- Keep Phase 9 routes under a dedicated namespace and behind feature, jurisdiction and entity-readiness flags.
- Use route handlers under `app/api/**`, colocated Zod schemas, `requireApiUser`, `jsonError`, additive migrations and explicit RLS.
- Use restricted storage, short-lived signed URLs, access logs and output review for all cooperative and research files.

## Required tests

- membership versus ordinary Tourify-account separation;
- purpose-specific contribution and revocation behavior;
- RLS for members, directors, committee reviewers, researchers, administrators and workers;
- small-cohort, concentration, stale-source and re-identification stop conditions;
- default-deny research access and output release;
- competition-sensitive content detection and escalation;
- idempotent external submissions and compensating rollback;
- regression coverage for upload, playback, entitlement, marketplace, feed, profile, EPK, analytics and mobile.

## Completion evidence

Codex may mark this area complete only after it records:

1. audited repository paths and deployed database objects;
2. approved legal/entity/governance assumptions and named operational owners;
3. migrations, generated types, RLS tests and route tests;
4. privacy, ethics, competition, security and jurisdiction review evidence;
5. feature flags, stop conditions, monitoring and rollback instructions; and
6. task-level files changed, commands run, test results and unresolved blockers in `phase-9-execution-plan.json`.
