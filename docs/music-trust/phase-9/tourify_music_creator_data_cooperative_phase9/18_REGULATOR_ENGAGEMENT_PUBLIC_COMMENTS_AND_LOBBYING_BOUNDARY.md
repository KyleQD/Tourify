# Regulator Engagement, Public Comments and Lobbying Boundary

## Purpose

Separate educational policy research, member consultation, public comments, lobbying, political activity and formal representation.

## Primary workflows

1. Classify each proposed communication and responsible entity.
2. Confirm member/board authority and jurisdictional registrations.
3. Disclose funding and conflicts.
4. Use approved evidence and avoid revealing confidential member data.
5. Archive submissions, meetings and commitments.

## Required controls

- No political contribution, lobbying registration or campaign activity through a research or standards flag.
- No statement that Tourify speaks for all creators.
- Members may dissent and remain non-retaliated against.

## Primary records

- `phase9_public_comments`
- `phase9_regulator_engagements`
- `phase9_advocacy_authorizations`
- `phase9_lobbying_reviews`
## Canonical source-of-truth rules

- `artist_music` remains the catalog anchor; Phase 9 stores references and approved extracts, not replacement catalog rows.
- Rights Passports, Phase 6 licences and Phase 7 administration/enforcement records remain immutable source evidence.
- Phase 8 consent, privacy and benchmark decisions are inputs, but cooperative membership and data contribution require new, separately executed records.
- External research institutions, regulators, standards bodies, CMOs, courts and government registries remain authoritative for their own decisions and filings.
- Every derived dataset, analysis, publication and benefit allocation points to an immutable input manifest and policy version.

## Stop conditions

Stop the workflow when any of the following is true:

- membership, contribution licence, consent, authority or permitted purpose is missing or expired;
- the source dataset cannot be reproduced from an approved lineage manifest;
- the cohort fails minimum-size, independence, concentration, delay or re-identification controls;
- the request would expose current or future competitive strategy, prices, bids, rates or contract positions;
- research ethics, privacy, security, export, IP, competition or jurisdiction review is incomplete;
- an output could be interpreted as legal, tax, investment or coordinated pricing advice;
- the board, member vote, independent committee or outside authority required by policy has not approved the action;
- a member withdrawal, legal hold, regulator request or incident requires processing to pause.

## Existing-system integration

- Consume approved, versioned extracts through adapters or event outboxes; never query confidential operational tables directly from public or researcher-facing routes.
- Do not modify upload, stream, entitlement, player, feed, profile, EPK, marketplace, licensing, rights-administration, royalty or mobile behavior.
- Keep Phase 9 routes under a dedicated namespace and behind feature, jurisdiction and entity-readiness flags.
- Use route handlers under `app/api/**`, colocated Zod schemas, `requireApiUser`, `jsonError`, additive migrations and explicit RLS.
- Use restricted storage, short-lived signed URLs, access logs and output review for all cooperative and research files.

## Required tests

- membership versus ordinary Tourify-account separation;
- purpose-specific contribution and revocation behavior;
- RLS for members, directors, committee reviewers, researchers, administrators and workers;
- small-cohort, concentration, stale-source and re-identification stop conditions;
- default-deny research access and output release;
- competition-sensitive content detection and escalation;
- idempotent external submissions and compensating rollback;
- regression coverage for upload, playback, entitlement, marketplace, feed, profile, EPK, analytics and mobile.

## Completion evidence

Codex may mark this area complete only after it records:

1. audited repository paths and deployed database objects;
2. approved legal/entity/governance assumptions and named operational owners;
3. migrations, generated types, RLS tests and route tests;
4. privacy, ethics, competition, security and jurisdiction review evidence;
5. feature flags, stop conditions, monitoring and rollback instructions; and
6. task-level files changed, commands run, test results and unresolved blockers in `phase-9-execution-plan.json`.
