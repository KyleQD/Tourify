# Phase 9 Scope, Dependencies and Boundaries

## Purpose

Define the legal, technical and operational boundary between Tourify and any creator-governed cooperative, data trust, research exchange, policy observatory, standards program or future collective entity.

## Primary workflows

1. Prove Phase 8 consent, privacy, competition and governance controls before accepting members or data.
2. Classify the proposed entity and every product capability before implementation.
3. Keep educational intelligence available without requiring cooperative membership.
4. Create separate approval gates for research licensing, policy advocacy, standards participation and collective representation.

## Required controls

- All Phase 9 product flags default off except internal readiness documentation.
- No cooperative public launch until governing documents, board, finances, member rights, privacy program and counsel opinions are approved.
- No data contribution or research access through ordinary Tourify terms.

## Primary records

- `phase9_entity_profiles`
- `phase9_approval_packages`
- `phase9_feature_decisions`
## Canonical source-of-truth rules

- `artist_music` remains the catalog anchor; Phase 9 stores references and approved extracts, not replacement catalog rows.
- Rights Passports, Phase 6 licences and Phase 7 administration/enforcement records remain immutable source evidence.
- Phase 8 consent, privacy and benchmark decisions are inputs, but cooperative membership and data contribution require new, separately executed records.
- External research institutions, regulators, standards bodies, CMOs, courts and government registries remain authoritative for their own decisions and filings.
- Every derived dataset, analysis, publication and benefit allocation points to an immutable input manifest and policy version.

## Stop conditions

Stop the workflow when any of the following is true:

- membership, contribution licence, consent, authority or permitted purpose is missing or expired;
- the source dataset cannot be reproduced from an approved lineage manifest;
- the cohort fails minimum-size, independence, concentration, delay or re-identification controls;
- the request would expose current or future competitive strategy, prices, bids, rates or contract positions;
- research ethics, privacy, security, export, IP, competition or jurisdiction review is incomplete;
- an output could be interpreted as legal, tax, investment or coordinated pricing advice;
- the board, member vote, independent committee or outside authority required by policy has not approved the action;
- a member withdrawal, legal hold, regulator request or incident requires processing to pause.

## Existing-system integration

- Consume approved, versioned extracts through adapters or event outboxes; never query confidential operational tables directly from public or researcher-facing routes.
- Do not modify upload, stream, entitlement, player, feed, profile, EPK, marketplace, licensing, rights-administration, royalty or mobile behavior.
- Keep Phase 9 routes under a dedicated namespace and behind feature, jurisdiction and entity-readiness flags.
- Use route handlers under `app/api/**`, colocated Zod schemas, `requireApiUser`, `jsonError`, additive migrations and explicit RLS.
- Use restricted storage, short-lived signed URLs, access logs and output review for all cooperative and research files.

## Required tests

- membership versus ordinary Tourify-account separation;
- purpose-specific contribution and revocation behavior;
- RLS for members, directors, committee reviewers, researchers, administrators and workers;
- small-cohort, concentration, stale-source and re-identification stop conditions;
- default-deny research access and output release;
- competition-sensitive content detection and escalation;
- idempotent external submissions and compensating rollback;
- regression coverage for upload, playback, entitlement, marketplace, feed, profile, EPK, analytics and mobile.

## Completion evidence

Codex may mark this area complete only after it records:

1. audited repository paths and deployed database objects;
2. approved legal/entity/governance assumptions and named operational owners;
3. migrations, generated types, RLS tests and route tests;
4. privacy, ethics, competition, security and jurisdiction review evidence;
5. feature flags, stop conditions, monitoring and rollback instructions; and
6. task-level files changed, commands run, test results and unresolved blockers in `phase-9-execution-plan.json`.
