# Mandate Delegation, Subdelegation and Revocation

## Purpose

Create exact-scope mandate records for federation services, representation networks, data transfers, standards participation and administrative actions.

## Primary workflows

1. Organization creates proposed mandate
2. Policy validates right, service, territory, term, counterparty and subdelegation rules
3. Required local approval is recorded
4. Federation accepts mandate within its approved service scope
5. Mandate expires, is revoked or is superseded without silent overwrite

## Required controls

- No global or perpetual mandate by inference.
- Subdelegation is prohibited unless expressly allowed.
- Revocation must propagate to credentials, APIs, jobs and external partners.

## Primary records

- `creator_federation_mandates`
- `creator_federation_mandate_scopes`
- `creator_federation_mandate_revocations`

## Canonical source-of-truth rules

- `artist_music` remains the canonical catalog anchor and is referenced, never duplicated or replaced.
- Rights Passports, licences, administration cases, royalty ledgers and official external records remain authoritative within their own domains.
- Federation records express organization relationships, credentials, mandates and decisions; they do not rewrite underlying rights or member records.
- Every derived record points to a versioned source, issuer, policy, jurisdiction, effective period and immutable audit event.

## Stop conditions

- Required entity, membership, mandate, consent, jurisdiction or governing-body approval is missing, expired, suspended or disputed.
- A requested action would allow one member organization or Tourify to override another organization’s lawful member decision.
- Cross-border data transfer, localization, privacy, security, sanctions, export or competition review is incomplete.
- The action could imply global representation, collective pricing, licensing, bargaining or legal authority that has not been separately granted.

## Existing-system integration

- Use dedicated Phase 10 namespaces and adapters; do not add a second upload, player, entitlement or catalog pipeline.
- Use Next.js App Router route handlers under `app/api/**`, colocated Zod schemas, `requireApiUser` and `jsonError`.
- Use additive Supabase migrations, explicit RLS, restricted storage, short-lived signed URLs and append-only audit/outbox records.
- Keep all Phase 10 feature flags disabled by default and require entity plus jurisdiction readiness before activation.

## Required tests

- Default-deny authorization and RLS for every organization, member, delegate, verifier, reviewer, administrator and worker role.
- Idempotent state transitions, webhook replay protection, versioning, revocation and compensating rollback.
- Cross-organization isolation, jurisdiction gates, expiry, suspension and local-sovereignty override prevention.
- Regression coverage for upload, streaming, access, Jukebox, mobile, marketplace, feed, profile, EPK, analytics, licensing, royalties and rights administration.

## Exit criteria

- Audited repository paths, deployed database objects, current provider contracts and named operational owners are recorded.
- Required legal, privacy, competition, cooperative-governance, security and jurisdiction approvals are attached.
- Migrations, generated types, RLS tests, route tests, monitoring and rollback instructions are complete.
- Task-level implementation and verification evidence is recorded in `phase-10-execution-plan.json`.
